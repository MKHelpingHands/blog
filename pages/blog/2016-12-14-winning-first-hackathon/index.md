A few weeks ago, after much trepidation, I decided to attend the athenhealth MDP
hackathon.  This was the first official hackathon with potential prizes that
I've ever entered.  I'm not entirely sure why I hadn't entered any competitions
prior to this event, especially considering when I was in sales competition
drove much of my greatest productivity.  Something about software development brews
emotions of imposter syndrome and not being good enough.
