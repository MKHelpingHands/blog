This is a self-referential meta blog post.  It's a blog post
about this blog.  A post about how to get the most from other posts.
In the spirit of Simon Sinek, I'll start with **why**.  Then
I'll cover **how** I created this blog and tips for getting the **most out of it**.
Finally, I'll delve into **where** it's going.  

If you don't really care why I created this blog and just want to learn how to
get the most out of it, [feel free to skip ahead.](#getting-the-most-out-of-posts)
